The static website of [my very self, me](https://github.com/anima-libera), generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted by GitHib (see [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)), accessible at [https://anima-libera.github.io/](https://anima-libera.github.io/) for the world to see.

For now, it is my portfolio of personal programming projects.
