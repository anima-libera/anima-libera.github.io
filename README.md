# Anima Libera's Website

Using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
I thought it may be a good idea to have a static website
in case I ever want to post something somewhere.

There is nothing really intresting on it yet,
except maybe an *extremely superior* color theme that is so beautiful
it permanently damages the retina and optic nerves of inferior people
that are not granted the virtuous gift of *good taste*.

The home page of the website is accessible
[here](https://anima-libera.github.io/) uwu~
