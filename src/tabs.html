	Tabs or spaces? Tough debate, holy war, no side getting close to a decisive victory.
	There are a lot of compilations of arguments for each side out there.
	In this last post, I would like to provide one more argument
	to take place in the great balance of things. An argument in favor of tabs.
</div>

<div class="item">
	Tabs are not characters whose width can be chosen in the editor settings.
	What is configurable is not the width of tabs, it is the width of the space between
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_stop">tab stops</a>.
	A tab is not multiple spaces, it is a character that dictates the rendering of text to
	continue from the next tab stop on the current line.
	Tabs have no width, they allow to shape the rendering of text for better readability.
	There is an other (commonly used) character with similar properties: the end-of-line.
	It does not have a width, but it does dictates the rendering of text to continue from
	the left in the next line (on Windows it is two characters, whatever).
</div>

<div class="item">
	It would not even come to mind to mimic the rendering behavior of end-of-line characters
	by inserting enough spaces to get to the end of the current line to force the editor into
	displaying the text that comes after on a new line. Then, <i>why</i> so many people find it so natural
	to mimic the rendering behavior of tabs when indenting by inserting enough spaces to get
	the text that follows to start at some arbitrary column?
</div>

<div class="item">
	One could consider a text as an end-of-line-separated list of lines.
	As each line is separated from the previous line (if any) by an end-of-line character,
	this separation can be extended by some number of tabs to indicate on which
	tab stop this line is to start from.
	So one could rather consider a text as an extended-end-of-line-separated list
	of <i>indented</i> lines, which really is what most source code files are.
